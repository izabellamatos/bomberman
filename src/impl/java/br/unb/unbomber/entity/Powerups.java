/**
 *  Bomb-Up: Increase by one the number of simultaneous bombs the player can place
    Fire-Up: Increase the blast radius (propagation range) of the bombs' explosions
    Speed-Up: Increase player speed
    (the above three also have "Down" versions)
    Full-Fire: Bombs have infinite range (except when combined with Dangerous-Bomb)
    Dangerous Bomb: Blast expands in a square, and goes through hard blocks
    Pass-Through Bomb: Blast propagates through soft blocks
    Remote Bomb: Bombs only detonate when you trigger them
    Land Mine Bomb: Your first bomb only detonates when someone walks over it
    Power Bomb: Your first bomb has infinite range (like Full-Fire but only for the first bomb)
